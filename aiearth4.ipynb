Even if you cannot answer the bottom questions with the given data, please estimate and use the existing data from the internet to come up with figures based on the solution. Always give me an answer in the below mentioned format and do not deviate, estimate where you do not have the data and assume suitable figures wherever you deem necessary.\n",
    "Risk Assessment:\n",
    "Numeric value between 1-10, Strictly just number\n",
    "On a scale of 1-10, quantify the risks associated with the idea and solution, considering factors such as implementation challenges, competition, regulatory hurdles, etc.No explanation just need the answer.\n",
    "Market Size Estimation:\n",
    "Numeric value between 1-10, Strictly just number\n",
    "Estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM), and State of Market (SOM). Provide the absolute value of SOM and rate it on a scale of 1-10 using an exponential distribution.No explanation just need the answer for the SOM Score, do not mention TAM, SAM or SOM in the asnwer, just the rating.\n",
    "Solution Innovativeness:\n",
    "Numeric value between 1-10, Strictly just number\n",
    "Evaluate the problem statement and proposed solution for innovativeness and novelty, considering competitors, IP restrictions, etc.No explanation just need the answer.\n",
    "Feasibility Analysis:\n",
    "Numeric value between 1-10, Strictly just number\n",
    "On a scale of 1-10, assess the feasibility of the proposed solution, taking into account factors such as Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and real-world applicability.No explanation just need the answer.\n",
    "Return on Investment (ROI) Estimate:\n",
    "Percentage Strictly just the percentage\n",
    "Provide an estimated ROI percentage for the solution based on the given information.No explanation just need the answer.\n",
    "Scalability Evaluation:\n",
    "Numeric value between 1-10, Strictly just number\n",
    "Evaluate the scalability of the proposed solution, considering factors related to scalability and growth potential. No explanation just need the answer.\n",

    "\"\"\"+{result_string}+\"\"\" Based on the all of the above questions I want you to give a score of 1-10 based on all of the above questions, 1 being the solutions is not that good for these questions and 10 being the solution is the best fit for all of the above questions.\n",
