## **Key Features** 🚀  

✔ **Dataset Filtering**: Filters solutions where the response contains at least **10 words**.  
✔ **AI-Based Assessment**: Uses **GPT-4** to analyze and classify solutions based on:  
  - **Solution Fit** ✅: Whether the solution aligns with the stated problem.  
  - **Circular Economy Fit** 🔄: If the solution supports sustainability principles.  
  - **Loop Classification** 🔁: Assigns solutions to one of four sustainability loops:  
    1️⃣ **Material Loop** *(Resource Efficiency)*  
    2️⃣ **Product & Energy Loop** *(Economic Sustainability)*  
    3️⃣ **Biosphere Loop** *(Environmental Conservation)*  
    4️⃣ **Social Loop** *(Community Impact)*  

✔ **Business & Market Analysis** 📊: AI generates structured ratings for:  
  - **Risk Assessment** (1-10)  
  - **Market Size Estimation** (1-10)  
  - **Solution Innovativeness** (1-10)  
  - **Feasibility Analysis** (1-10)  
  - **Return on Investment (ROI in %)**  
  - **Scalability Evaluation** (1-10)  

✔ **Ranking Mechanism** 🎯: Assigns a final **Loop Score** to identify **top solutions**.
